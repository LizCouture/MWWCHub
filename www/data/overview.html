        <h4>Our mission is to inspire, connect, motivate and move women through every stage along their path.</h4>
        <h4>Our goal is to bring together the MetroWest community of women during an annual full-day conference.</h4>
        The MetroWest Conference For Women, to be held on September 14, 2017 at the Sheraton Framingham, will provide an accessible and affordable opportunity for local women to make meaningful connections, share relevant perspectives, and learn from inspiring world-class speakers. There will be presentations and breakout sessions from 8:00am - 5:00pm with a pre-conference reception the evening of September 13th, giving attendees the opportunity to meet conference speakers.

        Incorporated as a nonprofit in December of 2016, the organization has an all-volunteer Board of Directors with 28 women and one man committed to investing their time and resources for the success of the conference.  We have over 150 years of experience in the MetroWest region in non-profit, corporate, business and government/public industries.  Knowing the needs of this region and the barriers to success that women face every day, we are committed to providing a conference for women in our region at an affordable price.
        <br/>

        Registration is $52 per person, which includes complimentary parking.  Our goal is to add information, resources, networking and mentoring within the MetroWest region that increases the opportunities available to women. We believe there is plenty of room in this space for more chances such as these, chances to re-ignite, re-evaluate, and respond.
