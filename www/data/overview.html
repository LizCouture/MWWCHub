                    Registration is $52 per person, which includes complimentary parking.  Our goal is to add information, resources, networking and mentoring within the MetroWest region that increases the opportunities available to women. We believe there is plenty of room in this space for more chances such as these, chances to re-ignite, re-evaluate, and respond.
