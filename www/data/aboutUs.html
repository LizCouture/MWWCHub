                        Incorporated as a nonprofit in December of 2016, the organization has an all-volunteer Board of Directors with 28 women and one man committed to investing their time and resources for the success of the conference.
                        We have over 150 years of experience in the MetroWest region in non-profit, corporate, business and government/public industries.  Knowing the needs of this region and the barriers to success that women face every day,
                        we are committed to providing a conference for women in our region at an affordable price. The mission of the <b> MetroWest Conference For Women </b> is to provide an accessible and affordable annual opportunity for local women
                        to make meaningful connections, share relevant perspectives, and learn from inspiring world-class speakers. Our goals include adding information, resources, networking and mentoring within the MetroWest region that increases
                        the opportunities available to women. We believe there is plenty of room in this space for more chances such as these, chances to re-ignite, re-evaluate, and respond.
